# Weather_Android
 This is a Weather App built using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and MVVM architecture. The app allows users to search for weather information by entering a city name or by using their current location. The weather data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API and displayed in a user-friendly interface, including weather icons, temperature, humidity, and other relevant details.
